## üéÆ Using Kiro for Game Development

### Step 1: Open Your Devvit Project

Navigate to your project directory and open it in Kiro:

```bash
cd my-devvit-app
kiro .
```

Or use **File > Open Folder** to select your project directory.

**Note:** Kiro may ask if you trust the authors of the files in this folder. Click "Yes" or "Trust" to proceed.

### Step 2: Create Your Game

1. Click the **Kiro Ghost icon** in the activity bar (left sidebar)
2. This opens Kiro's features panel with chat interface

Kiro offers two approaches for building features:

**Vibe (Recommended for Quick Development):**
- Direct, conversational approach
- Start building immediately without formal planning
- Best for rapid prototyping and simple features

**Spec (Alternative for Structured Development):**
- Formal requirements, design, and task phases
- Best for complex features requiring detailed planning

**Workflow:**
```
1. Select the Vibe option in the panel
2. Enter your prompt: 
   "Modify this Reddit Devvit app to create a tetris-like game with the following functionality:
   
   - Game grid with falling blocks
   - Score display and tracking
   - Reddit username integration
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - Line clearing mechanics
   - Restart button for new games
   
   Note: Don't change the app's name. Do NOT run any build commands or npm scripts, I will handle all building and deployment."
3. Kiro starts building immediately based on your description
```

![Game Prompt](../assets/images/kiro-game-prompt.png)

Kiro will start building your game step by step:

### Step 3: Test Your Game

Run the development server to see your game in action:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## ‚≠ê Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Include exact requirements and functionality in your prompts
- **Break Down Features**: Create detailed descriptions for complex game mechanics
- **Iterate with Chat**: Refine implementations through conversation
- **Test Frequently**: Build and test games regularly during development

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Installation Issues:**

- Run installer as administrator (Windows) or with proper permissions

**Project Not Loading:**
- Ensure project directory contains valid code files
- Check file permissions in project folder
- Restart Kiro and try reopening project

**Authentication Problems:**
